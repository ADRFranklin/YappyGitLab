# Yappy, the GitLab Monitor

Hi! My name is Yappy, the GitLab Monitor.
I am a bot that enables events from a GitLab repo(s) to be sent to a channel.

- You can choose a custom prefix with `GL! conf set prefix <NEW_PREFIX>`
- You can invite Yappy to your server at http://bit.ly/DiscordYappyGitlab.
- You can join Yappy's official server at https://bit.ly/DiscordYappyServer.

To learn how to set up Yappy, simply ask "GL! how to set up", or view the page called "Setting Up".

Keep in mind, however, that those recognitions are powered by an AI, and have a per-channel cooldown of 15 seconds.
